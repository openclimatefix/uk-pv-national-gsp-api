As part of Open Climate Fix’s [open source project](https://github.com/openclimatefix), the
Nowcasting API is still under development.

#### General Overview

__Nowcasting__ essentially means __forecasting for the next few hours__.
OCF has built a predictive model that nowcasts solar energy generation for
the UK’s National Grid ESO (electricity system operator). National Grid runs more than
300
[GSPs](https://data.nationalgrideso.com/system/gis-boundaries-for-gb-grid-supply-points)
(grid supply points), which are regionally located throughout the country.
OCF's Nowcasting App synthesizes real-time PV
data, numeric weather predictions (nwp), satellite imagery
(looking at cloud cover),
as well as GSP data to
forecast how much solar energy will generated for a given GSP.

Here are key aspects of the solar forecasts:
- Forecasts are produced in 30-minute time steps, projecting GSP yields out to
eight hours ahead.
- The geographic extent is all of Great Britain (GB).
- Forecasts are produced at the GB National and regional level (using GSPs).

OCF's incredibly accurate, short-term forecasts allow National Grid to reduce the amount of
spinning reserves they need to run at any given moment, ultimately reducing
carbon emmisions.

In order to get started with reading the API’s forecast objects, it might be helpful to
know that GSPs are referenced in the following ways:  gspId (ex. 122); gspName
(ex. FIDF_1); gspGroup (ex. )
regionName (ex. Fiddlers Ferry). The API provides information on when input data was
last updated as well as the installed photovoltaic (PV) megawatt capacity
(installedCapacityMw) of each individual GSP.

You'll find more detailed information for each route in the documentation below.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
And if you're interested in contributing to our open source project, feel free to join us!
